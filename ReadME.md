# Coure Project 2
# Exploratory Data Analysis

Aim of the project is to explore the National Emissions Inventory Database and answer the   following questions on fine particulate matter

###Question 1
Have total emissions from PM_{2.5} decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?  
### Answer 1
Answer to this question can be found using plot1.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot1.png   
Yes, total emissions has decreased

### Question 2
Have total emissions from PM_{2.5} decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008?  
### Answer2
Answer to this question can be found using plot2.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot2.png    
Yes, Overall there has been decrease.   
Although there was an increase observed in the year 2005 when compared to previous year 2002

### QUestion 3
Of the four types of sources indicated by the =type= (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad)   variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for   Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008?  

### Answer 3  
Answer to this question can be found using plot3.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot3.png   
ON-ROAD, NONPOINT, NON_ROAD sources have seen continuous decrease over the years   
POINT sources has seen increased emissions till 2005 after that there has been decrease  
Net emissions due to point sources in 2008 is nearly same as that in 1999  

### Question 4
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed    from 1999-2008?   

### Answer 4
Answer to this question can be found using plot4.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot4.png   

Overall total emissions from coal sources have been decreased over the years

### QUestion 5
How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City? 
### Answer 5
Answer to this question can be found using plot5.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot5.png   
Yes, Overall motor emissions in Baltimore has seen a decrease

### Question 6
Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor    vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes    over time in motor vehicle emissions?

### Answer 6

Answer to this question can be found using plot6.R. Result of the analysis is visualized 
in plot6.png    
Motor Emissions in Los Angeles is way higher when compared to Baltimore
